# Home Assistant Configuration

The documentation for [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) can be somewhat daunting
for the beginnger. By providing my
configuration, hopefully it will assist you and others with their configuraiton of their own instance.

## Tutorials

I've created tutorials for setting up various items and automations in Home Assistant.
Those tutorials are available to watch on my
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4HCouBLtXD1j1U_17aBqig) in the
[Home Assistant Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaAJ0fv0d9WMOGZmLnghrG321kVueGfuL).
